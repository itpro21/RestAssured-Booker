# RestAssured BDD Framework - Restful-Booker

Quick start:
1. Ensure Java 17 and Maven are installed.
2. From project root run:
   mvn clean test

Reports:
- Cucumber HTML: target/cucumber-reports.html
- Cucumber JSON: target/cucumber.json
- Allure: generate with `allure serve target/allure-results` (if Allure installed)

Project structure mirrors what you'd expect for Cucumber + TestNG + RestAssured tests.
